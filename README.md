## How to Play

Both players choose either X or O to mark their cells. There will be a 3Ã—3 grid with numbers assigned to each of the 9 cells. The player who chooses O begins to play first. He enters the index number where he wishes to place O. Now, both X and O play alternatively until any one of the two wins. Winning criteria: Whenever any of the two players has fully filled one row/ column/ diagonal with his symbol (O/ X), he wins and the game ends. If neither of the two players wins, the game is said to have ended in a draw.
